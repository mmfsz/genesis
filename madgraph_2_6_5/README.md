All of the code here is taken from the 2022 CMSDAS [example](https://github.com/agrohsje/genproductions/tree/cmsdas2020).
However, it has been consolidated for simplicity.
In addition, though Madgraph is used here, it is installed automatically in the gridpack generation step.
More information on how to use the code here can be found in this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/jkguiang/genesis/wiki/1.-The-Genesis-Device:-Madgraph).
